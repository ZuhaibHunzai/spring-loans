          THE OPERATOR OF THIS WEBSITE is a for-profit advertising network. We
          receive compensation, in the form of referral fees, from lenders,
          aggregators, credit repair services, or other offers that we direct
          you to. Therefore, the amount of compensation provided, along with
          other factors, may impact which offer you are presented. The offer you
          receive may be coming from the company that bid the most for your
          information. The operator of this website does not always provide you
          with an offer with the best rates or terms. Our website does not
          include all companies or all available offers. We encourage you to
          research all available loans options for your situation.<br /><br />
          * The operator of this website does not broker loans to lenders and
          does not make cash advances or credit decisions. This Website does not
          constitute an offer or solicitation to lend. This site will submit the
          information you provide to a lender. In some cases, you may be given
          the option of obtaining a loan from a tribal lender. Tribal lenders
          are subject to tribal and certain federal laws while being immune from
          state law including usury caps. If you are connected to a tribal
          lender, please understand that the rates and fees may be higher than
          state-licensed lenders and you may be required to agree to resolve any
          disputes in a tribal jurisdiction. Additionally, your information may
          be going to an aggregator and not a lender. Your information can be
          sold multiple times leading to multiple offers from lenders,
          aggregators, and other marketers. Providing your information on this
          Website does not guarantee that you will be approved for a cash
          advance. The operator of this Website is not an agent, representative
          or broker of any lender and does not endorse or charge you for any
          service or product. Not all lenders can provide up to $2,500. Cash
          transfer times may vary between lenders and may depend on your
          individual financial institution. In some circumstances faxing may be
          required. This service is not available in all states, and the states
          serviced by this Website may change from time to time and without
          notice. For details, questions or concerns regarding your cash
          advance, please contact your lender directly. Cash advances are meant
          to provide you with short term financing to solve immediate cash needs
          and should not be considered a long term solution. Residents of some
          states may not be eligible for a cash advance based upon lender
          requirements. <br /><br />
          ** Lenders may perform credit checks with the three credit reporting
          bureaus: Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion. Credit checks or consumer
          reports through alternative providers may be obtained by some lenders.
          <br /><br />
          ANTI-SPAM POLICY: We strictly prohibit any reference or advertisement
          of our brand and web site using unsolicited email messages. Violation
          of this policy will cause partnership termination and further actions
          permitted by the law. If you feel you have been sent unsolicited
          messages promoting our brand or website and would like to register a
          complaint, please refer to our Privacy Policy. We will investigate all
          complaints and take necessary action.
